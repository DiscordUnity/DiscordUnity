# DiscordUnity
A DiscordAPI made for Unity and only usable for Unity. It contains special features to make it all work.
This library only works below unity version 5.3.5!

### INSTALLATION
- Open the UnityProject where you want DiscordUnity.
- Double click DiscordUnity.unitypackage.
- Import the assets and you're set to go.

### HOW TO USE
I've put a very simple example demo to show of some basics off the api. Look inside script folder after DiscordExample.cs. 
Remember this library is still work in progress don't expect everything to work. If something doesn't work please message me on discord about it.

If you've any questions message me in private to BlindArcher#8149 or comment in the DiscordUnity channel: https://discord.gg/0SBTUU1wZTYk9iEh
