# DISCLAIMER This library is not being further developed since Unity applications should not be used to host bots or give user access to Discord within a game or distrbuted application. To access Discord from a distributed Unity application interface, you can use the Discord game SDK. If you have a special usecase however to use this library, feel free to fork and update the library as needed since I don't expect everything to keep working.

# DiscordUnity
A DiscordAPI made for Unity but also usable as a standalone .NET Standard library.

### INSTALLATION
- Open your UnityProject where you want to install DiscordUnity.
